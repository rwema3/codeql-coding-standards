## Deviation Records

| Rule ID | Query ID | Automated Scope | Scope | Justification | Background | Requirements
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A0-1-1 | cpp/autosar/useless-assignment | Applies to the following file paths: invalid |   |   |   |   | 
| A0-1-1 | cpp/autosar/useless-assignment | Applies to the following file paths: valid |   |  This useless assignment is required. |   |   | 
| A0-4-2 | cpp/autosar/type-long-double-used | Identified by the use of the code-identifier: a-0-4-2-deviation |   |  long double is required for interaction with third-party libraries. |   |   |

## Deviation Permits

| Permit ID | Rule ID | Query ID | Automated Scope | Scope | Justification | Background | Requirements
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DP1 |  |  | Application depends on the associated deviation records |   |  foo bar baz |   |   | 
| DP2 | A0-1-1 | cpp/autosar/useless-assignment | Application depends on the associated deviation records |   |   |   |   | 
| DP3 |  |  | Application depends on the associated deviation records |   |   |   |   | 

## Invalid Deviation Permits
| Path | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| invalid/coding-standards.xml:100:7:103:33 | Deviation permit does not specify a permit identifier. |
