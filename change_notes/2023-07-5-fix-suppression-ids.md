 * A number of rules had the wrong query ids attached for deviation purposes. This means they could not be deviated against using the correct ID, but could be incidentally suppressed when deviating a different rule. We have fixed this behavior for the following rules:
    - `RULE-11-4`
    - `DIR-4-12`
    - `RULE-21-6`
    - `RULE-21-9`
    - `MEM51-CPP`
